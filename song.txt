[Intro]
I don't know why I like it
I just do

[Verse 1]
I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

[Chorus]
I get so emotional, baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

[Verse 2]
I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk
I just watch your mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

[Chorus]
I get so emotional, baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

I get so emotional, baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

[Outro]
See I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional, baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
